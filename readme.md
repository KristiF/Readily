Welcome to Readily, the service that fetches and summarizes the latest articles for you. 

We have currently implemented the article summarization and the ability to browse the frontpage and read the articles. We still have some more features in to add:
* Login
* Saving articles
* Reading history
* Infinite scroll
Also currently the publish date when reading an article is wrong, we're working on a fix for that.

The presenters can be found in readify-app/src/pages. This is where the components (views) are rendered. The components can be found in readify-app/src/components. The public folder contains the assets used (logos). The lib folder contains a single function right now to fetch articles.
